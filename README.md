# AdventOfCode2021
This is my try to solve some of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - to learn their basics.

Application is build by [Node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). It's the npm project.

It's simple front is based on [Bootstrap Jumbotron example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/jumbotron/).

It's build with [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack), [TypeScript compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) and some other dependent plugins (see `package.json`).

For unit tests it uses TypeScript compiler and [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner.
For test run it uses [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).
